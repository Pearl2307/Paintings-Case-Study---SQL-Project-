# Paintings-Case-Study---SQL-Project-

This is a Case study done using SQL on a data set from kaggle . https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings

**Getting data into SQL using Python**

I automated the process of creating SQL tables for this project by using Python with SQLAlchemy. This approach effectively reduced the time investment compared to manual SQL setup.
Here is the code attached - https://github.com/Pearl2307/Paintings-Case-Study---SQL-Project-/blob/main/Python%20to%20SQL%20.ipynb

**Explaination**: This code efficiently creates tables in a PostgreSQL database using Python.

**1.pandas (pd)**: Powerful library for data manipulation (spreadsheets-like DataFrames).
sqlalchemy: Connects Python to relational databases (like PostgreSQL).
Steps:

**2.Connection String**: Defines credentials and connection details for your database.
Connection Engine: Creates a blueprint for interacting with the database.
Connection: Establishes a connection to the database using the engine.

**3.Benefits**:
Saves time compared to manual SQL commands.
Enables data manipulation and analysis using pandas DataFrames.

**Following is the list of SQL questions and Answers that I solved for this Case study**
